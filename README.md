### Common Core

The Common Core at 42 is the foundational stage of the curriculum, designed to provide a solid grounding in software engineering. Spanning 12 to 18 months, it prepares students for the technical challenges of the technology field through hands-on learning and real-world projects.

Students begin their journey by exploring programming in `C` and `C++`, progressing from fundamental concepts to advanced topics such as imperative and object-oriented programming paradigms. This rigorous introduction lays the groundwork for understanding the intricacies of coding and software development.

The curriculum also covers algorithms and data structures, equipping students with the skills to create efficient solutions and manipulate data effectively. These core topics are essential for tackling complex computational problems and optimising software performance.

In addition, students delve into system architecture and networking. They learn the basics of `UNIX` system administration, gain an understanding of network architecture, and explore client-server programming, essential for building reliable and scalable systems.

The programme further introduces graphic and web programming through projects like Fract-ol, which focuses on fractal creation, and `ft_transcendence`, which involves developing interactive web platforms. These projects allow students to experiment with creative and technical aspects of software design.

### Milestone 0

- [Libft](https://github.com/vinislima/42sp_common_core_libft)
    
    The **first milestone** at **42** is represented by the project **Libft**, which serves as one of the initial significant challenges students face after completing the basecamp. The primary goal of this project is to create a custom static library in C by reimplementing several standard functions from the C library (libc). Students must write their own versions of these functions, using a **Makefile** to compile the code properly. This library will be used in future projects, as reliance on the original standard C library functions is prohibited in most 42 projects. Through this milestone, students not only reinforce their understanding of fundamental programming concepts but also learn how to structure and organise code in a way that adheres to strict guidelines, which will be crucial for their success in more advanced projects. Additionally, it introduces them to automated testing and correction systems used by 42, such as the **Moulinette**, which evaluates code against specific criteria.

### Milestone 1

- [ft_printf](https://github.com/vinislima/42sp_common_core_ft_printf)
    
    The **ft_printf** project focuses on recreating the functionality of the standard C `printf()` function. It challenges participants to implement a custom version capable of handling various format specifiers, including `%c`, `%s`, `%p`, `%d`, `%i`, `%u`, `%x`, `%X`, and `%%`. The goal is to develop a structured and efficient implementation that adheres to strict coding standards, ensuring memory safety and avoiding undefined behaviour. This exercise also introduces variadic functions, allowing the handling of a variable number of arguments, and offers an opportunity to enhance programming skills in C.
    
    In addition to the mandatory requirements, the project includes optional bonuses such as supporting flags (`-0.# +`) and field width specifications. However, these are only evaluated if the core implementation meets all requirements perfectly. Upon completion, the custom `ft_printf()` can be added to the participant’s personal library (*libft*), making it a valuable tool for future C projects.

- [get_next_line](https://github.com/vinislima/42sp_common_core_get_next_line)
    
    The **get_next_line** project challenges participants to implement a function capable of reading one line at a time from a file descriptor. This function mimics the behavior of tools like `getline()` while adhering to strict constraints, such as dynamic memory management and efficiency. The project introduces concepts like static variables to retain state between function calls and buffered reading, ensuring optimal performance for both small and large files.

    Key features of `get_next_line` include:

    - Reading files incrementally using a buffer of predefined size (BUFFER_SIZE).
    - Returning complete lines, including the newline character (\n), if present.
    - Handling both standard input (stdin) and file descriptors.
    - Safely managing memory to avoid leaks or undefined behavior.

    This project emphasizes modularity, with the main logic distributed across helper functions for string manipulation and memory management. It tests the participant’s understanding of pointers, dynamic allocation, and error handling in C.

- [Born2beroot](https://github.com/vinislima/42sp_common_core_born_2_be_root)

    The **Born2beRoot** project introduces participants to system administration and the basics of virtualisation. The goal is to set up a virtual machine as a secure server, following strict guidelines. Participants choose between Debian or Rocky Linux to create a minimal and efficient environment without graphical interfaces.

    The project emphasises key system administration concepts, including secure access, user management, encrypted storage, and service configuration. Additionally, a custom monitoring script is developed to automate system status reporting.

    This challenge serves as an introduction to managing and securing servers, providing a strong foundation for future projects in system administration.
