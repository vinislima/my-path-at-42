# **My path at [42 S達o Paulo](https://www.42sp.org.br/)**

Portfolio of projects completed during my time at [42 S達o Paulo](https://www.42sp.org.br/).

42 S達o Paulo is an innovative educational institution that offers free software engineering training, using a unique peer-learning methodology based on practical projects. Without traditional teachers, the program is accessible 24/7 and lasts about 18 months, focusing on fundamental programming languages and advanced topics. The selection process includes an immersive phase called "Piscina", and the institution stands out for its high employability rate, with 85% of students entering the job market in the first year. Part of a global network with 35 campuses in 22 countries, 42 S達o Paulo prioritises diversity and inclusion, offering scholarships and developing not only technical skills but also essential competencies such as problem-solving and teamwork.

## **Projects**

- **Piscine**
    
    The Piscine is arguably the most crucial part of the 42 selection process, where we undertake a variety of projects, starting with the shell and progressing to tasks using the C programming language.

    - [Shell 00](https://github.com/vinislima/42sp_piscine_shell00)
        
        The "Shell 00" project, part of the 42 school C programming curriculum, introduces students to Unix shell scripting. The exercises progressively cover fundamental concepts, such as file permissions, basic shell commands, and scripting practices. Tasks include creating specific file outputs, working with Git commands, manipulating file systems, and writing scripts to automate operations like cleaning temporary files or identifying ignored files in a repository. The project emphasises meticulous attention to detail and peer-based evaluations, ensuring collaborative learning and mastery of shell programming basics.

    - [Shell 01](https://github.com/vinislima/42sp_piscine_shell01)
        
        The "Shell 01" project from the 42 school focuses on advanced shell scripting skills. It consists of exercises that develop proficiency in Unix commands and scripting logic, such as listing user groups, finding and counting files, extracting MAC addresses, and manipulating text output. Students are also challenged with creative tasks, like creating files with specific names and performing arithmetic operations using custom numeral systems. The project emphasises careful problem-solving, strict syntax adherence, and collaboration among peers while reinforcing core shell scripting concepts.

    - [C 00](https://github.com/vinislima/42sp_piscine_c00)
        
        The "C 00" project introduces foundational programming concepts in C, targeting beginners. The exercises focus on creating basic functions, such as printing characters, numbers, and combinations of digits, adhering to strict coding norms. Tasks include writing functions to display the alphabet in various orders, checking number signs, and generating formatted outputs like number combinations. The project uses the write function exclusively, ensuring a low-level understanding of output handling. It aims to instil discipline coding habits and a grasp of fundamental programming logic while encouraging collaborative learning and peer evaluation.

    - [C 01](https://github.com/vinislima/42sp_piscine_c01)
        
        This set of exercises focuses on fundamental pointer and array manipulation concepts in C, aiming to strengthen students' understanding of pointer operations. Each task requires implementing a function without using external functions, except for the write function in the string display exercise. The exercises cover tasks such as assigning values to integers via pointers, swapping values between integers using pointers, performing mathematical operations (division and modulus) with results stored in pointers, handling strings including displaying and counting characters, and reversing and sorting integer arrays. Students are required to submit their code files as per the specifications of each exercise.

    - [C 02](https://github.com/vinislima/42sp_piscine_c02)
        
        This set of exercises in the C 02 module of the 42 Piscine focuses on string manipulation and memory operations. It involves implementing custom versions of standard library functions (`strcpy`, `strncpy`, `strlcpy`) and utility functions to check string characteristics (e.g., whether strings contain only alphabetic, numeric, printable, uppercase, or lowercase characters). Other tasks include transforming strings (to uppercase, lowercase, or capitalising words), displaying non-printable characters in hexadecimal, and printing memory regions with a formatted representation.
        
        The exercises increase in difficulty and aim to strengthen understanding of C strings, pointers, and memory management. Students must adhere to strict coding norms verified by the Moulinette and should submit their work as specified to pass the automated tests.

    - [C 03](https://github.com/vinislima/42sp_piscine_c03)
        
        This module in the 42 C Piscine focuses on advanced string manipulation using functions that replicate behaviours from the C standard library. The tasks progress in difficulty, covering comparisons, concatenation, substring searches, and string length management.
        
        Students must follow strict norms and submit only the required files to pass the automated grading system, Moulinette. Adherence to these guidelines ensures the code compiles and functions correctly under specific compiler flags (`-Wall -Wextra -Werror`).
        
        ---
        
    - [C 04](https://github.com/vinislima/42sp_piscine_c04)
        
        Module C 04 focuses on string and numeric operations in C, blending fundamental skills like counting characters and outputting strings with intermediate tasks such as converting numbers between bases. The exercises build progressively, emphasising input validation and error handling, particularly in base conversions. This approach ensures a strong foundation for practical applications, such as handling user inputs and custom numeric systems, while strict norms and compiler constraints reinforce good coding practices for real-world development.
        
        Module C 04 provides a robust introduction to critical programming techniques in C, blending fundamental and intermediate concepts. By completing these exercises, students gain a deeper understanding of string and number manipulation, preparing them for more advanced challenges in subsequent modules.
