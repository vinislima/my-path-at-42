## **`Projects`**

* **`Piscine`**  
  `The Piscine is arguably the most crucial part of the 42 selection process, where we undertake a variety of projects, starting with the shell and progressing to tasks using the C programming language.`  
* [`Shell 00`](https://github.com/vinislima/42sp_piscine_shell00)

  `The main shell commands covered in the Shell 01 project are:`

* **`id`** `- Identifies the groups of a specified user and lists them in an organised format.`  
* **`find`** `- Locates files based on specific criteria, such as extensions, and displays their names formatted.`  
* **`ls`** `- Lists files and directories, often used to filter lines or create customised outputs.`  
* **`ifconfig or ip`** `- Retrieves the machine's MAC addresses.`  
* **`cat`** `- Displays and manipulates text files, used for transforming, sorting, or filtering content.`  
* **`Redirections and pipes`** `(|, >): Allow combining commands, saving outputs, or modifying information, such as in sorting or calculations (various exercises).`

  `The "Shell 00" project, part of the 42 school C programming curriculum, introduces students to Unix shell scripting. The exercises progressively cover fundamental concepts, such as file permissions, basic shell commands, and scripting practices. Tasks include creating specific file outputs, working with Git commands, manipulating file systems, and writing scripts to automate operations like cleaning temporary files or identifying ignored files in a repository. The project emphasises meticulous attention to detail and peer-based evaluations, ensuring collaborative learning and mastery of shell programming basics.`

* [`Shell 01`](https://github.com/vinislima/42sp_piscine_shell01)

  `The main shell commands introduced in the Shell 01 project are:`

* **`id`** `- Retrieves the groups associated with a specific user and formats them as a comma-separated list.`  
* **`find`** `- Searches the current directory and its subdirectories for files meeting certain criteria, such as .sh file extensions, and extracts their names without extensions.`  
* **`wc`** `and find - Combined to count files and directories recursively within a directory tree.`  
* **`ifconfig or ip`** `- Extracts and displays the MAC addresses of network interfaces.`  
* **`Complex file handling`** `- Creates files with unconventional names, testing the ability to handle special characters.`  
* **`ls with filters`** `- Skips every other line in directory listings to filter output.`  
* **`cat, sort, and pipes`** `- Combines commands to manipulate and transform text files, such as reversing and sorting logins in specific ranges.`

  `The "Shell 01" project from the 42 school focuses on advanced shell scripting skills. It consists of exercises that develop proficiency in Unix commands and scripting logic, such as listing user groups, finding and counting files, extracting MAC addresses, and manipulating text output. Students are also challenged with creative tasks, like creating files with specific names and performing arithmetic operations using custom numeral systems. The project emphasises careful problem-solving, strict syntax adherence, and collaboration among peers while reinforcing core shell scripting concepts.`

* [`C 00`](https://github.com/vinislima/42sp_piscine_c00)

  `This project serves as an introduction to fundamental C programming concepts, focusing on loops, conditionals, recursion, and adhering to coding standards.`

* **`ft_putchar`** `- Outputs a single character using the write function, providing a basic understanding of low-level character handling.`  
* **`ft_print_alphabet`** `- Displays the lowercase alphabet in ascending order, introducing loops and sequential character manipulation.`  
* **`ft_print_reverse_alphabet`** `- Outputs the lowercase alphabet in descending order, building on previous logic with reversed sequences.`  
* **`ft_print_numbers`** `- Prints all digits (0-9) in ascending order, reinforcing loop structures and number handling.`  
* **`ft_is_negative`** `- Outputs 'N' for negative integers and 'P' for positive or zero, introducing conditional statements and integer evaluation.`  
* **`ft_print_comb`** `- Displays all unique combinations of three different digits in ascending order, teaching nested loops and formatting.`  
* **`ft_print_comb2`** `- Outputs all combinations of two numbers (00 to 99) in ascending order, showcasing nested loops and paired number formatting.`  
* **`ft_putnbr`** `- Prints an integer, including handling edge cases like the minimum and maximum values for int, emphasising recursion and formatting.`  
* **`ft_print_combn`** `- Outputs all combinations of n digits (1 ≤ n ≤ 9) in ascending order, requiring advanced iteration and condition checks.`

  `The "C 00" project introduces foundational programming concepts in C, targeting beginners. The exercises focus on creating basic functions, such as printing characters, numbers, and combinations of digits, adhering to strict coding norms. Tasks include writing functions to display the alphabet in various orders, checking number signs, and generating formatted outputs like number combinations. The project uses the write function exclusively, ensuring a low-level understanding of output handling. It aims to instil discipline coding habits and a grasp of fundamental programming logic while encouraging collaborative learning and peer evaluation.`

* [`C 01`](https://github.com/vinislima/42sp_piscine_c01)

  `This project covers the topic of module C 01 from the 42 C Piscine, a series of programming exercises in C. It includes general instructions, an introduction to the subject, and a set of tasks focused on pointer and array manipulation.`

* **`ft_ft`** `- Takes a pointer to an int as a parameter and assigns the value 42 to the pointed int.`  
* **`ft_ultimate_ft`** `- Takes a pointer to multiple pointers (int), and assigns the value 42 to the pointed int.`  
* **`ft_swap`** `- Takes two pointers to int and swaps the values of the two integers.`  
* **`ft_div_mod`** `- Takes two integer values (a and b) and two pointers to int (div and mod). It divides a by b, storing the quotient in div and the remainder in mod.`  
* **`ft_ultimate_div_mod`** `- Takes two pointers to int (a and b). It divides the value of a by that of b, storing the quotient in a and the remainder in b.`  
* **`ft_putstr`** `- Takes a pointer to a char (string) and displays the string to standard output.`  
* **`ft_strlen`** `- Takes a pointer to a char (string) and returns the number of characters in the string.`  
* **`ft_rev_int_tab`** `- Takes a pointer to an int and the size of an array, and reverses the order of the elements in the array.`  
* **`ft_sort_int_tab`** `- Takes a pointer to an int and the size of an array, and sorts the array in ascending order.`

  `This set of exercises focuses on fundamental pointer and array manipulation concepts in C, aiming to strengthen students' understanding of pointer operations. Each task requires implementing a function without using external functions, except for the write function in the string display exercise. The exercises cover tasks such as assigning values to integers via pointers, swapping values between integers using pointers, performing mathematical operations (division and modulus) with results stored in pointers, handling strings including displaying and counting characters, and reversing and sorting integer arrays. Students are required to submit their code files as per the specifications of each exercise.`
