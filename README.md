# **My path at [42 São Paulo](https://www.42sp.org.br/)**

Portfolio of projects completed during my time at [42 São Paulo](https://www.42sp.org.br/).

42 São Paulo is an innovative educational institution that offers free software engineering training, using a unique peer-learning methodology based on practical projects. Without traditional teachers, the program is accessible 24/7 and lasts about 18 months, focusing on fundamental programming languages and advanced topics. The selection process includes an immersive phase called "Piscina", and the institution stands out for its high employability rate, with 85% of students entering the job market in the first year. Part of a global network with 35 campuses in 22 countries, 42 São Paulo prioritises diversity and inclusion, offering scholarships and developing not only technical skills but also essential competencies such as problem-solving and teamwork.

## **Projects**

### **Piscine**

The Piscine is arguably the most crucial part of the 42 selection process, where we undertake a variety of projects.

Starting with shell scripting and progressively advancing to tasks using the C programming language.

- [C 00](https://github.com/vinislima/42sp_piscine_c00)
    
    The "C 00" project introduces foundational programming concepts in C, targeting beginners. The exercises focus on creating basic functions, such as printing characters, numbers, and combinations of digits, adhering to strict coding norms. Tasks include writing functions to display the alphabet in various orders, checking number signs, and generating formatted outputs like number combinations. The project uses the write function exclusively, ensuring a low-level understanding of output handling. It aims to instil discipline coding habits and a grasp of fundamental programming logic while encouraging collaborative learning and peer evaluation.

    This set of exercises focuses on fundamental pointer and array manipulation concepts in C, aiming to strengthen students' understanding of pointer operations. Each task requires implementing a function without using external functions, except for the write function in the string display exercise. The exercises cover tasks such as assigning values to integers via pointers, swapping values between integers using pointers, performing mathematical operations (division and modulus) with results stored in pointers, handling strings including displaying and counting characters, and reversing and sorting integer arrays. Students are required to submit their code files as per the specifications of each exercise.

- [C 02](https://github.com/vinislima/42sp_piscine_c02)
    
    This set of exercises in the C 02 module of the 42 Piscine focuses on string manipulation and memory operations. It involves implementing custom versions of standard library functions (`strcpy`, `strncpy`, `strlcpy`) and utility functions to check string characteristics (e.g., whether strings contain only alphabetic, numeric, printable, uppercase, or lowercase characters). Other tasks include transforming strings (to uppercase, lowercase, or capitalising words), displaying non-printable characters in hexadecimal, and printing memory regions with a formatted representation.
    
    The exercises increase in difficulty and aim to strengthen understanding of C strings, pointers, and memory management. Students must adhere to strict coding norms verified by the Moulinette and should submit their work as specified to pass the automated tests.

### Warm Up

The **warm-up at 42** serves as a preparatory phase to revisit the essential programming fundamentals learned during the Piscine. These exercises cover topics such as loops, functions, pointers, and data structures, reinforcing both syntactical and semantic foundations of the C language.

Alongside technical skills, the warm-up introduces peer-to-peer evaluation, teaching effective communication, empathy, and collaboration, which are core values of the 42 learning methodology. This phase helps students gain confidence and readiness for the challenges of the 42 curriculum.

### Common Core

### Milestone 0

- [Libft](https://github.com/vinislima/42sp_common_core_libft)
    
    The **first milestone** at **42** is represented by the project **Libft**, which serves as one of the initial significant challenges students face after completing the basecamp. The primary goal of this project is to create a custom static library in C by reimplementing several standard functions from the C library (libc). Students must write their own versions of these functions, using a **Makefile** to compile the code properly. This library will be used in future projects, as reliance on the original standard C library functions is prohibited in most 42 projects. Through this milestone, students not only reinforce their understanding of fundamental programming concepts but also learn how to structure and organise code in a way that adheres to strict guidelines, which will be crucial for their success in more advanced projects. Additionally, it introduces them to automated testing and correction systems used by 42, such as the **Moulinette**, which evaluates code against specific criteria.

### Milestone 1

- [ft_printf](https://github.com/vinislima/42sp_common_core_ft_printf)
    
    The **ft_printf** project focuses on recreating the functionality of the standard C `printf()` function. It challenges participants to implement a custom version capable of handling various format specifiers, including `%c`, `%s`, `%p`, `%d`, `%i`, `%u`, `%x`, `%X`, and `%%`. The goal is to develop a structured and efficient implementation that adheres to strict coding standards, ensuring memory safety and avoiding undefined behaviour. This exercise also introduces variadic functions, allowing the handling of a variable number of arguments, and offers an opportunity to enhance programming skills in C.
    
    In addition to the mandatory requirements, the project includes optional bonuses such as supporting flags (`-0.# +`) and field width specifications. However, these are only evaluated if the core implementation meets all requirements perfectly. Upon completion, the custom `ft_printf()` can be added to the participant’s personal library (*libft*), making it a valuable tool for future C projects.
